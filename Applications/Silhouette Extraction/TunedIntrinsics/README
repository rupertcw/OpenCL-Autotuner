Notes about code and license:
* There is a lot of unused code/variables/abandoned tests etc. in the code.
This goes for the files Silhouette_Extraction.{h,cpp} and silhouette_extraction.cl.

* OpenCL headers is needed to compile, as well as oclUtils.cpp and oclUtils.h from NVIDIA
OpenCL SDK. These are not included in this package, as we haven't looked into the license.
To use this software, you should therefore get these files yourself. The license in
COPYING.LESSER explains the license for the files provided here, and only these files. 
All the source files we provide contains a license-note in the top of the file.

* Inspect the Makefile if you have problems to compile, and change it as needed.
